____________

RULES:
 - do not remove the credit
 - otherwise I do not care what you do
 - though it would be cool if you notified me if you used it! you don't have to but it means I get to see other people using my code and that's very nice
 
NOTES:
 - This code was designed for my curio characters from the Scatterstar Isles ARPG. Check it out here: https://www.deviantart.com/scatterstar-isles
 - As far as I know, this code is WYSIWYG friendly. Just be careful with the right-aligned elements, as deleting every character in them resets the formatting. This is an issue common to all instances of the pull-right span tag - I get around it by deleting all but the first character, entering the first letter of the intended entry, deleting the other first character, and proceeding as normal. Or just edit the HTML directly.
 - BORDER COLOR: #c5bf8c;
 - TEXT COLOR: #b8e76d;
   - You can change the text color if you really want I guess, but the GIF elements will have to be manually adjusted frame-by-frame to match. So I suggest keeping the text color or removing the GIF elements.
 - When adding additional tabs or pages, make sure that only ONE tab-pane element has the 'active' class - this element will be visible by default.

Griff Adair is an enigmatic young man, aged 18, who possesses the extraordinary ability to travel back in time. Despite his youth, Griff exudes a sense of intense focus and determination that belies his age. Standing at 6'3" with jet black hair and piercing blue eyes, his intimidating appearance often causes others to keep their distance. A scar across his left cheek serves as a reminder of a past filled with hardships and close encounters. Griff's abilities allow him to jump back in time up to five hours, but the toll it takes on his physical and mental state limits his jumps to smaller increments, typically only 5 to 30 seconds. This power emerged during a traumatic event in his late teens, setting him on a path of solitude and introspection.

                                       Highly introverted, Griff prefers to avoid people and large crowds, using his abilities to work as a freelance information broker. He leverages his power to gather intelligence, operating from the shadows where he feels most comfortable. Griff's primary goal is to understand the origins and limits of his time-jumping abilities, hoping to expand or better control them. Driven by a need for redemption from past mistakes, he strives to protect innocent people from the unintended consequences of his jumps. Despite his intimidating exterior, Griff carries the heavy emotional burden of his power and the responsibility it brings, pushing him to use it judiciously and with great care.

                                        Amidst his solitary existence, Griff Adair finds solace in the companionship of his pet cat, Midnight. This fluffy, fully black cat with a sassy attitude is Griff's only constant friend and source of comfort. Midnight's playful antics and occasional bursts of affection bring a rare warmth to Griff's otherwise isolated life. The bond between them is strong, with Midnight often perched on Griff's shoulder or curled up beside him as he meticulously plans his next move. Despite his intimidating demeanor, Griff's gentle care for Midnight reveals a softer, more tender side of him, highlighting the depth of his character beyond his formidable exterior.

Griff Adair's life began in a rough neighborhood where survival often took precedence over dreams. Raised by his father, a hardworking man who did his best despite a poor upbringing, Griff learned early on the harsh realities of life. His father, though loving and supportive, struggled to provide a stable and positive environment due to his own lack of resources and education. This left Griff with a strong sense of self-reliance and determination to create a better future for himself.

In the midst of these challenges, Griff found refuge in his academics. He poured himself into his studies, seeing education as the key to escaping the cycle of poverty that had plagued his family. His relentless effort in school set him apart, earning him recognition from teachers and peers alike. However, it was during his early high school years that Griff's life took a dramatic turn. During a particularly dangerous encounter, his latent ability to travel back in time suddenly manifested. This power, initially frightening and overwhelming, became both a burden and a blessing, enabling him to escape immediate danger but also forcing him to confront the immense responsibility that came with it.

As he learned to harness his abilities, Griff's focus shifted towards understanding and controlling his newfound power. The experience of his fatherâ€™s struggles and his own challenges fueled his desire for redemption and protection, driving him to use his abilities to gather information and help others, albeit from the shadows. Through it all, Griff's determination and resilience, shaped by his upbringing and the bond with his father, remained his guiding force.
